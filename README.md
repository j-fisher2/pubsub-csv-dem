For GCP data pipeline: 

1. Command to test dataflow job `python pipeline.py   --runner DirectRunner   --project $PROJECT   --streaming`
2. Command to test data job responsiveness `gcloud pubsub topics publish pedestrian_input \
--message='{"image_path": "gs://path-to-gs-image"}' \
--project=$PROJECT`

Pipeline Architecture

Input Data: Pub/Sub messages containing the GCS image paths.
Preprocessing: Each image is downloaded from GCS, and YOLOv5 is used to detect pedestrians, while MiDaS is used to estimate depth.

Object Detection (YOLOv5):
YOLOv5 is used for detecting objects (pedestrians in this case). It provides bounding box coordinates (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax) and a confidence score for each detection.

Depth Estimation (MiDaS):
The MiDaS model provides depth information for the entire image, which is then interpolated to match the original image size. The depth for the pedestrians is averaged from the depth map.

Output: The output consists of a list of pedestrians with their bounding box coordinates, average depth, and detection confidence. These are published as messages in another Pub/Sub topic (pedestrian_output).
